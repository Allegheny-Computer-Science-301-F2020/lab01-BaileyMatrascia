- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Your answer here
 The article's premise is that smart phones have become exponentially more popular and common to the public. The technology to access, collect, and store user
 data has also exponentially increased. With big data, companies are able to categorize people and all based on their personal information gathered from
 what one does on their phone and even where they go. They are therefore free to do whatever they want with this data.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Your answer here
 Issues here include privacy and getting personal information without the consent of the common person. The idea of basically creating a digital identity of you and
 potentially infringing upon our own freedoms and rights as an individual. One who is unknowingly having there information being stored also does not know the full
 ethical standards of many of these companies(phone companies and applications/websites the user has easy and consistent access to)
 as they more often than not do not say what they stand for or if they even care about your privacy in terms of company
 storages. You do not know if the company is working for something else and has ulterior motives. Another is the concern of security. Even if a person does willingly
 accept and give up their information for convenience and the company has no ill intentions, how secure are these websites from potential threats of hacking.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Your answer here
 Data that is being manipulated is your personal information as with smartphones it is even easier with the technology to collect user data.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Your answer here
 As I understand it, the analysis here is that the accessibility to our personal information has become, and is growing, more easier for these companies with
 the creation of smart phones. Our information is being stored without our consent and being used for advertising and other things we may or may not be aware of.
 Through simply using our smartphones, a digital identity of ourselves is being create and stored and labeled as big data. Beyond even our information, they are even
 paying attention to our behaviors and what we do and coming up with whatever conclusions they can and doing whatever they wish with that information. And in the
 study conducted in the article, most people have negative views concerning having their personal information unknowingly being stored and tracked yet these companies
 seem to keep improving the technology and pushing for more individual surveillance some may phrase it.


- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Your answer here
The common smart phone user stands to lose their privacy and rights while these smartphone companies and other companies win in having
and upper hand in knowledge over the common person to do whatever they please whether it be through business/marketing means or some ulterior motive
that is not known to the public.

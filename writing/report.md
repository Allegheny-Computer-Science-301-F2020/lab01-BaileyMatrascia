- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Your answer here
 The article's premise is that smart phones have become exponentially more
 popular and common to the public. The technology to access, collect, and store
 user data has also exponentially increased. With big data, companies are able
 to categorize people and all based on their personal information gathered from
 what one does on their phone and even where they go. They are therefore free to
 do whatever they want with this data.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Your answer here
 Issues here include privacy and getting personal information without the
 consent of the common person. The idea of basically creating a digital identity
 of you and potentially infringing upon our own freedoms and rights as an
 individual. One who is unknowingly having there information being stored also
 does not know the full ethical standards of many of these companies
 (phone companies and applications/websites the user has easy and consistent
 access to) as they more often than not do not say what they stand for or if they
 even care about your privacy in terms of company storages. You do not know if
 the company is working for something else and has ulterior motives. Another is
 the concern of security. Even if a person does willingly accept and give up
 their information for convenience and the company has no ill intentions, how
 secure are these websites from potential threats of hacking.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Your answer here
 Data that is being manipulated is your personal information as with smartphones
 it is even easier with the technology to collect user data.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Your answer here
 As I understand it, the analysis here is that the accessibility to our personal
information has become, and is growing, more easier for these companies with
 the creation of smart phones. Our information is being stored without our
 consent and being used for advertising and other things we may or may not be
 aware of. Through simply using our smartphones, a digital identity of ourselves
 is being create and stored and labeled as big data. Beyond even our
 information, they are even paying attention to our behaviors and what we do
 and coming up with whatever conclusions they can and doing whatever they wish
 with that information. And in the study conducted in the article, most people
 have negative views concerning having their personal information unknowingly
 being stored and tracked yet these companies seem to keep improving the
 technology and pushing for more individual surveillance some may phrase it.


- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Your answer here
The common smart phone user stands to lose their privacy and rights while these
smartphone companies and other companies win in having and upper hand in
knowledge over the common person to do whatever they please whether it be
through business/marketing means or some ulterior motive
that is not known to the public.

### Article 2

 The Rise of Data and AI ethics

-  Reference or article citation.

 https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/government-trends/2020/government-data-ai-ethics.html

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Your answer here

 The article's premise is that since the sudden rise of technology the
 opportunity to collect larger and larger amounts of personal data more
 frequently is becoming the norm, the government has not taken the time to sort
 out laws according to ownership and rights over data on the internet similar
 to how there are laws for property of land.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Your answer here
The ethical concern is that people do not have ownership over their own
personal information that can be easily and sometimes unknowingly gathered
by various different companies who do not even claim security or prioritize
privacy and protection of user data. Since these companies are gathering this
information they are treating it as their own information to do whatever they
please and share that data with whomever they want.

Overall there is a lack of accountability over AI and a misuse of data and
people have no rights over their own protection from this over breach of privacy.


- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Your answer here
 Data that is being manipulated in this article is for the most part personal
 data and the claim and ownership and accountability over the data itself.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Your answer here

There is a dilemma over the ownership of the rise of data found through
computers. In one sense, the AI of these programs are not always fully
understood even by the developers themselves and not always realize that
sometimes the AI is taking or tracking even more than they are thinking it is.
The developers are simply problem solving and focusing on a goal and doing it
as efficiently as possible. In another sense, there is no ownership over the
data as in a general sense(as of now) it is information and knowledge so the
individual does not have control over their own privacy of information. So these
companies are technically just collecting "research information" using AI but
the fact that they are collecting your data, how/when they are collecting it,
and every purpose they are collecting it for is not publicly known makes it
an opportunity for dangerous misuse and opportunity for manipulation. The
government does not own the data as well as it is information however, they
do have the power to pass laws to protect the individual but there is also
a thin line between giving a user personal rights over their own personal
information and ownership and potentially using this protection law in the
future to restrict individual from information and claiming ownership over
no physcial things that are not created. It is possible to not cross that line
and have a safe medium which should be done for our safety and protection
but it opens the door for a potential information ownership war and making
information and knowledge something to own and potentially restrict access to.


- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Your answer here
 As of now the individual user stands to lose something because the individual
 has no rights over these companies taking their information. The companies
 stand to win because they gain something from this lack of rights the
 individual has and the rest, including the companies, remain unaccountable
 for the actions and infringing of private information the individual did not
 give rights to giving away.
